# challenge-openspace-classifier


***Description:***

Welcome to the Openspace Classifier project! Our company recently moved to a new office 
with an open space layout consisting of 6 tables, each with 4 seats, making up 24 seats. 
To help colleagues get to know each other better, we reassigned seats daily. 
This program automates the daily re-assignment of seats, ensuring a random and fair distribution.


***Installation:***

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/challenge-openspace-classifier.git
cd challenge-openspace-classifier


***Usage:***

Ensure you have an Excel file with a list of colleagues.
Run the main.py script with the file path to the Excel file as an argument to organize 
and display the seating arrangement:

python main.py --file path/to/file.xlsx
